Do NOT change logic.
Do NOT refactor.
Only adjust layout styling.

Requirements:

2) Icon and text must be vertically centered within the card.
3) Reduce node card height (make it compact).
4) Reduce top and bottom padding.
5) Maintain balanced spacing (8–10px between icon and text).
6) Keep connection dots aligned vertically with the new reduced height.

Return only updated layout/style code.
